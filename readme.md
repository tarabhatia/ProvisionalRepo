## Overview
### Description
This app would allow users to identify and document things around their community that need to be fixed and repaired. Users would be able to upvote issues that they think should be addressed. This would create a sense of urgency for city officials to take on the issue.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Awareness, Community Building
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer.Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features. The pro of having this as a mobile application would be to implement crowdsourcing, instant notifications, and in-car navigation with maps.
- **Story:** Users are able to log in and select territories they are interested in. They have the ability to add an issue they see and upvote other issues they feel strongly about and create a sense of urgency about it. For example, city officials who hear in passing that a broken faucet in a public park restroom needs fixing might not perceive a significant sense of urgency to initiate repairs, but they would get a different picture when 50+ individuals want them to fix it. In the same way, our application would showcase trending issues that people are passionate about with a map interface.
- **Market:** People in residential areas and pretty much anyone living with in a non-secluded area.
- **Habit:** It should be used whenever people see things that should be repaired and wish to make note of it.
- **Scope:** The application does seem possible to complete. We would need to integrate a maps API and maybe add some gamification to motivate users to interact with the app and fix issues.
